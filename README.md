# Galaxy
This game is basic one which involves the piece on the screen navigating through the path in space.

# Installation
To install the game, it is best to create a virtual environment and to run in vs code. To install a virtual environment in vs code execute the command in vs code's terminal
```
python --m venv virtual_env
```
and put all the files and folders into the folder of the virtual environment. 
The next thing is to install the required version of Kivy library. To install Kivy-2.3.0 for cpython 3.8 install the file Kivy-2.3.0-cp38-cp38-win_amd64.whl for windows x64.
Execute the command
```
pip install Kivy
```
and it will install the kivy library.
Once this is done then the environment will be setup and we can run the program from any IDE
